X SERVER
 x server was developed in MIT for research purposes.

 X -  capital X on the command line will start the X server
 xinit - will give graphical environment (basically looks like a normal command line to type our comands on)

	e.g - xclock (on the terminal we get after xinit) will start display clock;
			- ctrl +  to kill the clock
		- twm (tabed windows manager) this is not quite modern one 
			- xeyes 
			- xclock    these are examples of windows that can be opened are 		minimized after twm is running in the back ground.

		- metacity &   - the & sig will make the new file mamager to run in the background.
			- xeyes 
			- xclock  - noow the to will have more interactive windows like - minimize maximize close buttons.   

Xorg -configure   -this will create xorg.conf.new file
